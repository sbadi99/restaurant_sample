* The Project is written in Kotlin 
* From a architecture standpoint, used the LiveData/ViewModel approach and best practices (MVVM) (per Android architectural components) to allow for UI layer to be decoupled from the business layer. 
* Used RxJava and Retrofit2 on the networking side. 
* Used MockWebServer for unit testing api end-points
